# AIPI-XAI-Explainable-Deep-Learning
This project implements Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to analyze the decision-making process of a deep learning model using Saliency Maps. The goal of the study is to investigate whether there is a significant difference in pixel importance between correctly classified and misclassified images of "cats" by a pre-trained ResNet50 model.
